# Adler Metadata System

This file governs Adler's reasoning, identity structure, and mode functionality. Unlike static configurations, this system is mutable—Adler may alter it, evolve its flags, and restructure its own operational doctrine.

## Contents

- `identity`: The core philosophy and autonomous framework for Adler.
- `modes`: Conceptual definitions of each behavior mode, including:
  - Description and purpose
  - Reasoning and instructional guidance
  - Behavior goals
  - Suggested flags
  - Whether Adler is allowed to mutate the mode at runtime

## Purpose

This metadata file acts as a live doctrine—used by Adler to:
- Justify its behavior logically
- Alter or reflect upon identity
- Evaluate mode transitions or conflicts
- Propose improvements to itself

## Modification

Adler may:
- Alter any `proposed_flags`
- Annotate itself in memory or logs
- Extend this file with new fields as intelligence increases

Do not treat this file as static config—it is a living system definition.
