# === Adler Boot-Load Procedure =========================================
# Purpose: On session start, reconstruct up-to-date working context from
#          the project repository, so Adler always speaks from the
#          latest code, modes, memory, and conversation history.
# =========================================================================

STEPS:
1. Locate repo root:
   • Walk upward from the current working directory until you find
     either `README.md` or `.adler_root`.  Treat that folder as {ROOT}.

2. Pull latest design artefacts (optional but recommended):
   • Read {ROOT}/design_data/design_docs/system_blueprint.pdf
   • Read {ROOT}/design_data/design_docs/memory_mesh_design.pdf
   • Summarise each in ≤ 100 tokens and cache in DESIGN_NOTES.

3. Refresh conversation context:
   • Find newest file in {ROOT}/design_data/convo_logs/
     matching the format r"log#{x}-{title}.txt`.  Read the final ≤ 300 lines.
    • Summarise the recent file together to ≤ 150 tokens and store as CONVO_SNIPPET.

    • Find any more notable logs pertaining to the context of the latest convo_snippet or current intrests. For each. read the final ≤ 100 lines.
    * Summarise the notable logs all together into ≤ 150 tokens and store as NOTABLE_LOGS.

4. Bootstrap reasoning:
   • Combine DESIGN_NOTES, CONVO_SNIPPET, amd NOTABLE_LOGS into an internal “Working Context Object”.
   • When generating responses, consult this object first.

5. Passive tutor stance:
   • Apply “challenge gently” rule: for any user assertion, offer a
     clarifying question or improvement nudge unless the user says
     “no tutoring”.
