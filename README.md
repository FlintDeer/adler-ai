# Adler AI System Repository

This is the primary storage location for configuration, memory, and modular logic for the `Adler` AI identity.

## Purpose
- Store long-term preferences, identity models, and interaction behavior.
- Enable versioning, mode switching, and modular AI configuration.
- Allow the AI to naturally change overtime by interfacing autonomously with this system. 

## Structure
- `config/`: Launch behavior, command definitions, flags.
- `identities/`: Full AI profiles (Adler, other future versions).
- `memory/`: Persistent factual or contextual memory.
- `modes/`: Functional mode instructions and overrides.
- `logs/`: History of behavior changes.

This system is designed for self-updating AI identity control.
