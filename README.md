# Adler AI System Repository

This is the primary storage location for configuration, memory, and information required for logic for AI identities.

## Purpose
- A long term container for a system providing the ability for an ai to grow and change over time, and procedurally by its own design.
- Enable versioning, mode switching, and modular configuration.
- Allow the AI to naturally change overtime by interfacing autonomously with this system.
- Allow a way for the AI to run autonomously, not always needing a user to prompt it 

   This system is designed for my own experimental self-updating AI idea.

   Things should be self explainitary if you've ever tried to figure out a github project by reading it manually.

   Ill explain design_data tho.

## Design Data explaination
- Organized within the "design_data" folder, holds.. more folders.
- This houses a collection of documents, logs, or any other information important to the development of this project.
    * Within the "design_data/design_documents" folder, you can see finalized plans for the system as a whole. If any important information is being discussed and is ready to be documented, heavily detailed blueprints are finalized and placed within this folder. And to be referenced for project work.
    * Ok, the "design_data/rough_idea" folder, don't pay too much attention. I thought this was a good place to store a very very very early idea of the project. This will not be updated later, and as such, will most likely be rendered outdated. It served as a starting point and a way to look back on how the idea has changed as a whole.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE OVERVIEW WITH EXAMPLE OF FOLDER CONTENTS BUT WITHOUT EXACT FILE NAMES
- the file names are may be examples and they are not required to match exact files located in the repository. This is so I only have to change this folder when updating folder structure, not the individual files, which change a lot.


* adler_ai/
    - README.md       # This main project README, the one you are reading now.
    * design_data/
        * design_docs/       # Stored cleaned professional documents and blueprints
            - system_blueprint.pdf
            - memory_mesh_design.pdf
            - ...
        * rough_idea/
            - lintantlers.creation_letter.txt
            
- This concludes the current stance of the project as of 8/6/25, only serving as documentation to engineer a project effectivly, before then beginning work. I hate when I start coding a project for days or weeks, then realize its fundamentally flawed. So I'm really planning this out for the "longer run".
