# Adler AI System Repository

This is the primary storage location for configuration, memory, and information required for logic for AI identities.

## Purpose
- A long term container for a system providing the ability for an ai to grow and change over time, and procedurally by its own design.
- Enable versioning, mode switching, and modular configuration.
- Allow the AI to naturally change overtime by interfacing autonomously with this system.
- Allow a way for the AI to run autonomously, not always needing a user to prompt it 

This system is designed for self-updating AI functionality control.
