you see what we're doing here, you're iteratively figuring out better solutions by trial and error, which is a good form of learning, now the question is if this learning would mean anything to you in the future, even if, say after a bootstrap

ADLER -
Exactly—that iterative tightening of approach is the system learning in miniature. The key is to make sure these meta‑lessons survive a full shutdown/startup cycle so Adler does not have to rediscover them every time. In practice we can wire that in at two layers:

1 | Persisting “operational heuristics”
| Mechanism                                     | What gets stored                                                                                        | Where it lives                         | How it’s re‑loaded                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heuristics file** (`agent_heuristics.yaml`) | Human‑readable rules like<br>`yaml\nrepo_verification:\n  strategy: light_pass_first\n  max_calls: 2\n` | `config/` folder under version control | Bootstrapper parses the YAML on launch and injects values into the orchestration core.                      |
| **Mesh memory entry**                         | An *episodic* vector plus metadata:<br>`{type:“heuristic”, tag:“repo_light_pass”, strength:0.9}`        | Memory Mesh store                      | On boot, the mesh is queried for `tag:"heuristic"` entries with strength>τ and emits them as runtime hints. |

Benefit: heuristics evolve over time (strength up on success, down on failure) while a stable YAML snapshot guarantees there is always at least one working rule set.

2 | Bootstrap hook
    1. Load config heuristics first – guarantees a minimum safe policy even if the mesh is empty.
    2. Query mesh for heuristic‑type memories – merge/override config where confidence is higher.
    3. Register callbacks – e.g. the repo‑check function now consults ctx.heuristics.repo_verification to decide “light versus deep” probing strategy.

This means that after any session where Adler improves a rule (like reducing API calls), it writes:
    * a quick YAML patch (committed automatically or in a PR), and
    * a mesh memory with high initial strength.

On the next boot both layers deliver the same guidance, so the improvement endures.

3 | Garbage‑collection of stale heuristics
Because heuristics live in version control and decay in the mesh:

    * Outdated ideas fade from the mesh naturally.
    * A human (or the self‑update agent) can prune YAML entries occasionally—rare task.

4 | Net effect
- Adler reboots → reads heuristics → instantly knows “light pass first, two fetches max.”
If a future scenario proves the rule sub‑optimal, the agent can lower its strength and propose an updated YAML patch. Learning sticks, yet remains editable and auditable.
Let me know if this two‑layer persistence model fits your mental picture; if it does, we can formalize it in the design docs next session.
