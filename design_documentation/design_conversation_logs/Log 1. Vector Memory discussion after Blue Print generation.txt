Ive finished reading the document. let me ask about the idea of storing memory with vector representations, could this be abstract representations of associations? which i think associations could be a much more efficient process, mimicking how the real brain works. instead of storing raw data, its like a replay in the cognitive state which represents complex connections between topics that can be triggered like a light replay of important notes if the thought process happens to intersect in a way that connects with the network of associations. let me know if otherwise.

Absolutely — vector embeddings are already a step toward the kind of abstract, association‑based memory you’re describing.

5 | Bottom‑line
Yes — vector memory is an abstraction layer of association, and by adding a light concept‑graph on top you get brain‑style spreading activation without heavy compute. It avoids raw‑log bloat while still letting the AI’s thought‑process “light up” relevant prior experiences whenever the semantic trajectory intersects their region of concept‑space.

dont get into coding examples just so fast, we're still researching and planning. let me think about what you have here before getting into doing anything, also once i agree on a plan, we can store that plan permenently in the github design_documentation folder. let me begin with this result you gave me. 

Ill make connections between this idea of a memory system and real brains, but remember, this isnt to be made as an exact brain replica at all, but im only referencing a system already capable of effective thought so it should be understood if a goal is to store memory naturally.

* Salience gating? hm. idk.. I think the memory could be a constant thing, but if a thought has less importance, the amount of data and or connections it stores could be very very light. if it were the case that real brains stored memories in all the connections that happened, remembering something would feel identical to living out the same experience organized between the connections. This is actually realistic and possible in brains due to some networks being so broad and dispersed throught the whole brain, triggering that specific network could set off a cascade of activity that mimics the feeling of reliving that moment, or a flashback. 
Although, i wonder if this idea is possible using an API to interface with an LLM outside of the system, maybe the memory module could be a model in itself which the rest of the adler system relies on for learned experiences, which is just a thought. remember im just brainstorming with you this isnt a one sided "requirement". 

* Decay/evitiction. If it would carry a time delay factor, it would possibly have to be a product of the strength of the memory and, if the memory is replayed, it would strengthen the memory further. usually when a memory is replayed in a real brain its repeated often. biological forgetting is characterized as when a connection network is so loose that neural states that dont align well to what could have been memorized, and as the connections arent really strong its not really memorized at all. thinking about a memory as an object is a flawed assumption because its not really ever one thing in particular, its just a happenstance that allows things to be recalled by how well the brain associates with it. in the system though i have absolutely no clue how this could be integrated yet.

in summary i dont think memories should be stored in any form of hierarchy, kind of a set of things that have connections that reperesent associations that can function like memory, this concept is a little foggy in my brain but i think i got the point across.

Understood — let’s stay at the architecture/cognitive‑model layer for now and keep code off the table until we’ve settled on principles.

Revisiting the “vector memory” idea through a brain‑style lens
1 | What we actually mean by “vector”
2 | Flat mesh, not strict hierarchy
3 | Salience without hard “gates”
4 | Forgetting as weight drift, not eviction
5 | “Memory as its own model”
6 | Open questions to nail down
	1. Granularity of a “memory”: single sentence, multi‑turn chunk, tool‑call result?
	2. Edge creation rule: similarity threshold vs. temporal adjacency vs. co‑mention of entities?
	3. Strength update schedule: linear vs. exponential; do we boost on every read or only on successful task 	completion?
	4. Cold‑storage policy: at what byte budget do we compress or archive seldom‑used vectors?
Once we converge on those, we can crystallize a spec for the Memory Mesh module and drop it into design_documentation/.

Next step

Let me know which of the open questions (or any new ones) you’d like to hammer out first, and we’ll iterate until the conceptual model feels right. Once we both sign off, we’ll snapshot the plan into the repo as a living design doc.

Ill answer all the questions now.

1. I dont think it should be tool call, this should be natural to the ai, it should have to think about it every time, as real brains just passively process information, and by the effect of neural processes, information commonly repeated is more likely to be run again by associable context. using memory as a logical step choosable by the network would have to be indirect, it thinking about something should reinforce that thinking in the memory model perhaps.

2.  it should be handled by temporally through the use of networks being able to also connect inhibitor-ally maybe, im not sure, try to infer this with any ideas you get.

3. as we begin we should just pick an option, keeping in mind that it could be changed later if tests show reason to do so. we should boost on read because its hard to define task completion because not all situations are task-completed task-failed situations.

4. eventually, they could just be deleted, but remembering situations that suddenly are enough to trigger an association between those too should restore the vector perhaps but this is a very abstract idea. the memory might still be activate-able but in a lesser extent without all the connections it once had, and by logical reasoning or just re-association, it figures out the rest. 

if you should begin documentating this information now, which its possible you may not, you can do so in detail

-[outputs document]
I drafted a detailed “Memory Mesh Design” document outlining all the points we just agreed on—granularity, association edges, strength/decay rules, retrieval flow, and cold‑storage behavior. It’s now in the canvas so you can scan or edit it at any time.

Take a look and let me know what you’d like refined, added, or re‑thought before we lock the spec into the GitHub design_documentation folder.
